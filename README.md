# cs6350_homography

● From the single view image of an inclined texture I’ we try to estimate both the homography matrix, H and the orthogonal image, I.<br/>
● The reconstructed input image I is displayed as that would have been visible before and after transformation from the H matrix.<br/>
● The model is analysed by calculating the MSE between the real image and reconstructed image using the homography matrix.
